# Live-Video-To-Sketch-OpenCV

### About the Project
Today we are going to make a Real-time/ live Sketch making script using OpenCV in Python. 
OpenCV makes it very easy for us to work with 
images and videos on the computer. We will also make use of Numpy and Matplotlib to make this live sketch app.
