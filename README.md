# Live-Video-To-Sketch-OpenCV

# What is OpenCV
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. 
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products
- The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and 
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human 
actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, 
stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene


# Live Sketch Algorithm OpenCV
1. **Capturing Real-time Video** from the source example – computer’s camera
2. **Reading each frame of the video**, so that we can make manipulations on the frame.
3. Converting each frame from **colored to grayscale**, using OpenCV functions.
4. Making Use of **Blurring** on the **grayscale** image to remove all the noises on the picture/image. **( Gaussian Blur )**
5. **Detecting Edges** of the blurred image, for making it like a sketch of the person or object. **(Canny Edge)**
6. **Thresholding** the **Edge Detected** image.

### About the Project
Today we are going to make a Real-time/ live Sketch making script using OpenCV in Python. 
OpenCV makes it very easy for us to work with 
images and videos on the computer. We will also make use of Numpy and Matplotlib to make this live sketch app.
