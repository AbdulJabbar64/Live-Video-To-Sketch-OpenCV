# Live-Video-To-Sketch-OpenCV

### About the Project
Today we are going to make a Real-time/ live Sketch making script using OpenCV in Python. 
OpenCV makes it very easy for us to work with 
images and videos on the computer. We will also make use of Numpy and Matplotlib to make this live sketch app.

# Live Sketch Algorithm OpenCV
1. **Capturing Real-time Video** from the source example – computer’s camera
2. **Reading each frame of the video**, so that we can make manipulations on the frame.
3. Converting each frame from **colored to grayscale**, using OpenCV functions.
4. Making Use of **Blurring** on the **grayscale** image to remove all the noises on the picture/image. **( Gaussian Blur )**
5. **Detecting Edges** of the blurred image, for making it like a sketch of the person or object. **(Canny Edge)**
6. **Thresholding** the **Edge Detected** image.
